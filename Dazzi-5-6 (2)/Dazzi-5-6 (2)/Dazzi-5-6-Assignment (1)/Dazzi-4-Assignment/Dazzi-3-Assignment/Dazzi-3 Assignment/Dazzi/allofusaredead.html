      <p class="text-center fs-1">All of Us Are Dead Season 2: Filming, Release Date, Cast, and Everything You Need to Know</p>
      <hr>
      <p class="text-start text-danger fs-2">Warning: Spoilers for season 1 of Netflix's All of Us Are Dead ahead.</p>
      <p class="fs-5">Over the last couple of years, Netflix has been releasing some of the best South Korean dramas out there. From Squid Game to D.P and Twenty Five Twenty One, the streaming giant has been delivering when it comes to K-dramas across various genres — from comedies to thrillers and, of course, good ol’ romance. One of the most popular titles to join Netflix's K-drama roster was zombie story All of Us Are Dead (지금 우리 학교는).</p>
      <img src="pic2.jpg" alt="Scene from All of Us Are Dead" class="img-fluid my-4">
      <p class="fs-5">Starring Park Jihu and Yoon Chanyoung, All of Us Are Dead premiered on Netflix on January 28, 2022, and quickly climbed up Netflix’s Global Top 10 rank. According to Variety, the series accumulated 124.79 million hours viewed in its first week, which then made it the most-viewed premiere week for a South Korean title since Netflix’s public Top 10 launched. Naturally, fans who finished the series started frantically looking for All of Us Are Dead season 2 updates on Google as soon as season one ended. If that’s you, here’s what you need to know about the series and its return.</p>
      
      <p class="text-start text-danger fs-2">Is Season 2 of All of Us Are Dead confirmed?</p>
      <p class="fs-5">Yes, it is! On June 6, 2022, Netflix confirmed All of Us Are Dead had officially been renewed for a second season on Twitter. The streamer also unveiled a Season 2 announcement video featuring some of the cast. “The students of Hyosan High School may have survived their first zombie outbreak, but the nightmare is far from over," the announcement description reads.</p>
      <video controls class="img-fluid" src="videoplayback.mp4"></video>
      
      <p class="fs-5">As previously noted by Hypebae, Lee Jaekyu, the director of the series, had noted that “the story was written with a second season in mind.” His idea was to continue the story, and Netflix is making that happen. “It would be great if we could do a second season,” the director reportedly said in the past, teasing that “if it were to happen, there would be more interesting stories.” Lee might focus more on the “zombie survival” during its sophomore season, which would make sense. But… before we get into that. Let's recap for a second.</p>

      <p class="text-start text-danger fs-2">When is All of Us Are Dead season 2 premiering? Has filming begun?</p>
      <p class="fs-5">When the All of Us Are Dead season 2 announcement was unveiled on June 6, 2022, Netflix said the project would be “coming soon,” but two years later, we are still waiting and it looks like we will be waiting a lot more. As reported by Star News Korea on May 23, 2024, production for All of Us Are Dead season 2 has been delayed until 2025 to accommodate for more high-level production. The report states that production for season 2 was initially supposed to start this year.</p>

      <p class="text-start text-danger fs-2">How many episodes will All of Us Are Dead season 2 have?</p>
      <p class="fs-5">Season one of All of Us Are Dead featured 12 episodes, clocking in at just under or over an hour each for a combined total of 728 minutes. (Believe us, once you hit play on the first episode, you’ll want to watch the rest right away.) It's unclear if season 2 will stick to the same number of episodes and length yet but that's usually the case with Netflix productions.</p>
      <p class="text-start text-danger fs-2">Who's in the cast of All of Us Are Dead season 2?</p>
      <p class="fs-5">Season one of All of Us Are Dead centers mainly around Nam Onjo, played by 18-year-old Park Jihu, and her childhood friend, neighbor, and classmate Lee Cheongsan, played by 20-year-old Yoon Chanyoung. Cho Yihyun also stars as model student and class president Choi Namra, while South Korean-Uzbek actor Park Solomon (also known as Lomon) plays Lee Suhyeok. The main antagonist of the series — aside from, you know, the virus itself — is Yoon Gwinam, played by real-life sweetheart Yoo Insoo. Lee Yoomi, whom you might recognize from Squid Game, plays Lee Nayeon. Additional casting includes Im Jaehyuk as Yang Daesu, Lee Eunsaem as Park Mijin, Ham Sungmin as Han Gyeongsu (a.k.a. Chaongsan’s BFF), Kim Jooah as Yoon Isak (a.k.a. Onjo’s BFF), as well as Son Sangyeon and Ha Seungri as siblings Jang Woojin and Jang Hari — among others.</p>

      <p class="fs-5">If you’ve already watched Season 1 of All of Us Are Dead, you’d know the series ends on a cliffhanger after the survivors reunite with Namra on the school’s rooftop. Unlike with Squid Game, it’s difficult to guess who could return for the second season since, you know, dead people can become zombies, too. We can assume all the survivors (or at least most) will return now that Season 2 has gotten the green light.

      <p class="fs-5">Realistically speaking, we shouldn't get our hopes up but, that said, stranger things have happened. (And this is Netflix after all!) Speaking to Wikitree, director Lee said: "If Cheongsan were to come back to life, there will be some viewers who won't accept the situation and some that will like it," noting that he “definitely” has a plan that he can't share just yet.</p>
